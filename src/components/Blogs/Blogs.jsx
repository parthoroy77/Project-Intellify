                            React is a component based modular JavaScript libraries for building UI. React build every part of UI by component. It create a virtual DOM which a lightweight copy of real DOM. When in DOM a small piece is updated React doesn't re-render the full UI it compare virtual DOM and real DOM which part is changed and identify the part then update the small part in real DOM by DIFF algorithm. In this method is the full website doesn't need to refresh so that user can get a optimal experience.
